This project was created to be use as example of differents front end folder structure and compare it. So, it has three branches as listed below:
  - type-based: In this branch the architecture split the files in folders respoecting the types. For example, all js files that connects with API are in same folder, all that are components in same folder, etc
  - feature-based: In this branch the files are grouped by features. For example, in MoviesList folder you have all js files to have this list movies feature working, including js to show informations on page, js to connects with api, components that integrate this feature, etc.
  - feature-and-type-based: In this branch the files are grouped by features. For example, in MoviesList folder you have all js files to have this list movies feature working, including js to show informations on page, js to connects with api, components that integrate this feature, etc. Inside the feature folder those js are organized by types, so the feature components are on same folder, the feature api in the same folder, etc.
